\title{DWT representation}
\usage{
repr_dwt(x, level = 4, filter = "d4")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the numeric vector (time series)}

\item{level}{the level of DWT transformation (default is 4)}

\item{filter}{the filter name (default is "d6").
Can be: "haar", "d4", "d6", ..., "d20", "la8", "la10", ..., "la20", "bl14", "bl18", "bl20",
 "c6", "c12", ..., "c30". See more info at \code{\link[wavelets]{wt.filter}}.}
}
\value{
the numeric vector of DWT coefficients
}
\description{
The \code{repr_dwt} computes DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) representation (coefficients) from a time series.
}
\examples{
# Interpretation: DWT with Daubechies filter of length 4 and
# 3rd level of DWT coefficients extracted.
repr_dwt(rnorm(50), filter = "d4", level = 3)
